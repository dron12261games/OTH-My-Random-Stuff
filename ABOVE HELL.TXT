Description             : E4M1: Hell Beneath remake of Ultimate Doom.
                          Speedmaped in about 6 hours long. A remake in the
                          style of A Doom Odyssey 2022. Since I'm a big fan
                          of the mapping of Kristian Aro, Paul Korfiatis,
                          A2Rob, etc., and my mapping style incorporates a
                          lot from their work, a map like this went
                          naturally.
