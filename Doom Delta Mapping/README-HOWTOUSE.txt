Here is a summary of the files included in this here archive:

	- maps/MAP01.wad
		* A zoo of all the placable actors. Only used for reference and should
		not be included in your mapset.
	- DELTAMAP.txt
		* Required for Doom Delta to register your mapset as a Doom Delta
		mapset. This will disable Doom Delta's map modification stuff so you can
		map without Doom Delta messing you up.
	- MAPINFO.txt
		* Includes the required editor numbers to place Doom Delta actors. You
		can base your own MAPINFO off this file, or throw the contents into your
		existing MAPINFO if you have one.
