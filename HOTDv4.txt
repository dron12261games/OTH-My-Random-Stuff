Advanced engine needed  : Should run on any relatively new (as of January 28,
                          2023) Boom-compatible port. For the best gaming
                          experience, I recommend using Doom Retro, Eternity
                          Engine, Woof! or ZDoom 2.8.1.
Primary purpose         : Single play

Title                   : Hotel of the Dead
Filename                : HOTDv4.wad

Other Files By Author   : There have been no publicly released projects yet.
                          Only various publications in closed communities.
Misc. Author Info       : Mapper, mod maker, programmer, and quite a bit of
                          pixel art artist.

Description             : Initially the first version was created in 3 days
                          for the community project "666crets", organized by
                          RED77. Later, after another extra day of revisions,
                          the current version was ready for separate
                          distribution as a standalone .wad file, not tied to
                          the framework of the community project.

			  The level was designed to:
			  Software Render (or Software-like)
			  No Jump
                          
                          Storyline:
                          You come to your senses on the street 
                          outside the hotel building and suddenly 
                          find crowds of demonic creatures all 
                          around you. You realize that you need 
                          to get out of the place as quickly as 
                          possible. 
                          But there's HE waiting outside the main 
                          gate. Knowing that you are incapable of 
                          confronting this horror now, you have no 
                          choice but to take refuge in the hotel 
                          building itself. 
                          There is no easy way out...

                          Special thanks to DeathWish, for helping me figure
                          out a couple of technical nuances in implementing
                          the 3D elevator under Boom (the one on the street
                          leads to the second floor).

                          666crets community project, which gave birth to the
                          idea for this map.
